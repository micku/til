Having a TIL-log is a great way to keep track of my knowledge and make it harder to forget.

Today I found this [article on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27017604) from [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) who was inspired one year ago by [Josh Branchaud's collection](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

Some days ago I installed [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), so I will take the opportunity to test it out with this project!

I still don't know what the subjects of this TILs will be, there will be software engineering, maybe some other topics that affect my life.

[Josh Branchaud's "How I Built a Learning Machine" article](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9) is a great resource of information and has a lot of interesting resources; I will try to stick to some of his rules:

* Keep it small, max 200 words;
* Make it quick, it should take less than 15 minutes.

I would like to host these on GitHub and maybe publish to [DEV](https://dev.to/beeman/automate-your-dev-posts-using-github-actions-4hp3).
