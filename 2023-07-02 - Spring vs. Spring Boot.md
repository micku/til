I'm starting my journey into Java engineering in a few weeks, and my company is using *Spring* as the framework of choice.

I'll do the switch from Typescript and Node.js, and have never worked with Java (outside of some Android dev).

So here is the thing: everyone talks about *Spring*, but it wasn't clear to me that, [Spring](https://spring.io/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) are related, but, are **not** the same thing. What I'm understanding is that *Spring Boot* is part of *Spring*, and kind of a de facto standard for *Spring development*. So the *Spring* term is, most of the times, not refereed to *[Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)*.

So, in short, Spring Boot is Spring with sane defaults and automation. It was created to reduce the **huge** amount of configuration work needed to start a Spring application.

A few features provided by Spring Boot:
- It is opinionated, they give you some standards to follow; but
- You can break the rules if you wish;
- Tries to auto-configure Spring and 3rd party libraries; and
- Gives you ways to explicitly configure things.

And, of course, [many many more](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.x/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html).
